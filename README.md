# PFLOTRAN_E4D_Coupling
The PFLOTRAN_E4D_Coupling is to couple PFLOTRAN and E4D. <br>
1. PFLOTRAN is an open source, state-of-the-art massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport code. For more information: https://www.pflotran.org/. <br>
2. E4D is a three-dimensional (3D) modeling and inversion code designed for subsurface imaging and monitoring using static and time-lapse 3D electrical resistivity (ER) or spectral induced polarization (SIP) data. For more information: https://e4d.pnnl.gov/Pages/Home.aspx. <br>

There are three parts included into this workflow:
1. Part A: E4D Installation and Jupyter Kernel Customization;<br>
2. Part B: Kernel customization on NERSC;<br>
3. Part C: E4D Mesh generation.<br>
4. Part D: PFLOTRAN_E4D Mesh Interpolation.<br>
5. Part E: PFLOTRAN Variables Mapping to E4D and Forward Mode Running.<br>

Please read 'README' file in every individual folders to avoid unnecessary work.<br>
Currently, the notebook is still under construction. More function and better structure will be added to the notebook. <br>
Thank you for reading. If you have any questions or have any feedbacks, please contact hongsheng.wang@vt.edu.
